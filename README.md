# Cemetery
<em>Cemetery</em> is a recompilation of my failed, abandoned and spur-of-the-moment kind of projects. This includes unfinished projects, unpolished ideas and testing little apps that I create as a way to learn a new concept.

### Overview
Each project is contained inside its own folder. Each folder has a quick overview of the project as the folder name. In example:

  > <strong><em> [JS-ES6][React, GraphQL] GraphQL Chat </em></strong>

As you can see, the folder name it's divided in 3 sections:
  > <strong><em> [JS-ES6] </em></strong>
  Shows the language that project was developed on.
  In this case, shows that it was developed using Javascript ES6.

  > <strong><em> [React, GraphQL] </em></strong>
  This is optional but it shows if the project was developed using one or more specific technologies/framework/libraries.
  In this case, shows that it was developed using ReactJS and GraphQL.

  > <strong><em> GraphQL Chat </em></strong>
  Name of the project itself. This can be anything but it's most likely to be a name that describes what the project is or does.
  In this case, a chat using GraphQL for the API.

Also, an individual project description can be found inside each folder.
