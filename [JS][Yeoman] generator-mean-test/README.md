A quick and simple generator, enough for showing the power of yeoman as a app generator.

To install, cd into the project folder and run
```
  $ npm link
```

After that, you can used inside any folder running
```
  $ yo mean-test
```

This will generate the app using the current directory as the root, so it's better if you run it inside an empty folder.
